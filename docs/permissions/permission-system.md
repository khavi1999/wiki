## Members with the server permissions
All members with the `ADMINISTRATOR` or `MANAGE SERVER` server permission have full access to the bot everywhere.

## Members with a server role named **PollCreator**
All members with the server role named `PollCreator` also have everywhere and full access to the bot.  
The role `PollCreator` must be **created manually** for this purpose.  
The role does not require any special permissions, only the name of the role is important.

## Text channels with **easypoll** in the name or description/topic
All members in text channels that contains `easypoll` in name or description (topic).  
Just create or edit a text channel and put the word `easypoll` in the channel name or in the channel description.  
All members have permissions to create a poll there. They can only close their own polls.
