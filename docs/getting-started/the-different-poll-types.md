## Normal Polls
- Normal polls have **no special features**.
- Results and participating members are **visible to everyone.**
- The reactions on the poll remain visible and are not removed by the bot.

## Anonymous Polls
- Anonymous polls have the feature that they are **completely anonymous**.
- Results are **only visible after closing** the poll or anytime with `/listpolls`.
- **Participating members are not visible for everyone, not even for administrators.**
- The reactions on the poll are removed by the bot. As a confirmation, the member receives by default a confirmation of successful voting via direct message.
- To remove the vote, the member must vote for the option again. Also here there is a confirmation via direct message.

## Hidden Polls
